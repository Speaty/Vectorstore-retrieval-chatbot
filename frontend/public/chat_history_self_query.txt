Q: what is it like to be a bat?
A: [(Document(page_content="WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE A BAT?\n Our own experience provides the basic  material  for our imag-\n ination, whose range is therefore  limited. It will  not help  to try\n to imagine that  one has webbing  on one's arms,  which enables\n one to fly around at dusk  and dawn  catching insects  in one's\n mouth; that one has very poor vision, and perceives the sur-\n rounding world by a system of reflected high-frequency  sound\n signals; and that one spends the day hanging upside down by\n one's feet in an attic. In so far as I can imagine  this (which  is not\n very far), it tells me only what it would be like for me  to behave\n as a bat behaves. But that is not the question. I want to know\n what it is like  for a bat to  be a bat. Yet if I try to imagine  this,  I\n am restricted  to the resources of my own  mind, and  those  re-\n sources are inadequate to the task. I cannot perform it either  by\n imagining additions to my present  experience, or by imagining\n segments gradually subtracted from  it, or by imagining some\n combination of additions, subtractions, and  modifications.\n To the extent that I could look  and behave like a wasp  or a\n bat without changing my fundamental structure, my experiences\n would not be anything like the experiences of those  animals.  On\n the other hand, it is doubtful that  any meaning can be attached\n to the supposition that  I should possess the internal neurophysio-\n logical constitution of a bat. Even if I could  by gradual  degrees\n be transformed into a bat, nothing  in my present constitution\n enables me to imagine what the experiences  of such a future\n stage of myself  thus metamorphosed would be like.  The best\n evidence would come from  the experiences  of bats, if we  only\n knew what  they were like.\n So if extrapolation from our own case is involved  in the  idea\n of what it is  like to be a bat, the extrapolation must  be incomple-\n table. We cannot  form more than a schematic  conception  of what\n it is like. For example, we may ascribe  general types  of experience\n on the basis of the animal's structure  and behavior.  Thus we\n describe bat sonar as a form of three-dimensional forward  per-\n ception; we believe that  bats feel  some versions  of pain, fear,\n hunger, and lust, and that they have other, more familiar types\n of perception besides sonar. But we believe that these  experiences\n also have in each case a specific subjective character, which  it is\n beyond our ability  to conceive. And if there is conscious  life else-\n 439", metadata={'page': 5.0, 'source': 'knowledge_base\\What Is It Like to Be a Bat by Thoma Nagel (z-lib.org).pdf'}), 0.11469799999999997), (Document(page_content="11. What  Is It Like  to Be a Bat? 161 \nvivid  (though  it certainly  could  be raised \nwith other  species).  Even  without  the \nbenefit  of philosophical  reflection,  anyone \nwho has spent  some  time  in an enclosed \nspace  with  an excited  bat knows  what  it is \nto encounter  a fundamentally  alien  form \nof life. \nI have  said  that  the  essence  of the \nbelief  that  bats  have  experience  is that \nthere  is something  that  it is like  to be a \nbat. Now  we know  that  most  bats  (the \nmicrochiroptera,  to be precise)  perceive \nthe external  world  primarily  by sonar,  or \necholocation,  detecting  the  reflections, \nfrom  objects  within  range,  of their  own \nrapid,  subtly  modulated,  high-frequency \nshrieks.  Their  brains  are designed  to cor-\nrelate  the outgoing  impulses  with  the sub-\nsequent  echoes,  and  the information  thus \nacquired  enables  bats  to make  precise  dis-\ncriminations  of distance,  size,  shape,  mo-\ntion,  and  texture  comparable  to those  we \nmake  by vision.  But  bat sonar,  though \nclearly  a form  of perception,  is not similar \nin its operation  to any  sense  that  we pos-\nsess, and  there  is no reason  to suppose \nthat it is subjectively  like  anything  we can \nexperience  or imagine.  This  appears  to \ncreate  difficulties  for the notion  of what  it \nis like  to be a bat.  We  must  consider \nwhether  any  method  will  permit  us to ex-\ntrapolate  to the inner  life of the bat from \nour own  case,5  and  if not,  what  alterna-\ntive methods  there  may  be for understand-\ning the notion. \nOur own  experience  provides  the ba-\nsic material  for our imagination,  whose \nrange  is therefore  limited.  It will  not help \nto try to imagine  that  one  has webbing  on \none's  arms,  which  enables  one  to fly \naround  at dusk  and  dawn  catching  insects \nin one's  mouth;  that  one  has  very  poor \nvision,  and  perceives  the  surrounding \nworld  by a system  of reflected  high-fre-\nquency  sound  signals;  and that  one spends \nthe day hanging  upside  down  by one's  feet \nin an attic.  In so far as I can imagine  this \n(which  is not very  far),  it tells  me only \nwhat  it would  be like for me to behave  as \na bat behaves.  But that  is not the question. I want  to know  what  it is like for a bat to \nbe a bat.  Yet if I try to imagine  this,  I am \nrestricted  to the  resources  of my  own \nmind,  and  those  resources  are inadequate \nto the task.  I cannot  perform  it either  by \nimagining  additions  to my present  expe-\nrience,  or by imagining  segments  gradual-\nly subtracted  from  it, or by imagining \nsome  combination  of additions,  subtrac-\ntions,  and  modifications. \nTo the extent  that  I could  look  and \nbehave  like  a wasp  or a bat  without \nchanging  my fundamental  structure,  my \nexperiences  would  not  be anything  like \nthe experiences  of those  animals.  On the \nother  hand,  it is doubtful  that  any  mean-\ning can be attached  to the supposition  that \nI should  possess  the internal  neurophysio-\nlogical  constitution  of a bat.

Q: experiments with loudness and pitch
A: [(Document(page_content="SPECIAL ISSUE: THE MAGICAL NUMBER SEVEN 345\nto the usefulness of the ratings. Pollack's results indicate that,\nat least for pitches, this intuition is fairly sound.\nNext you can ask how reproducible this result is. Does it de-\npend on the spacing of the tones or the various conditions of\njudgment? Pollack varied these conditions in a number of ways.\nThe range of frequencies can be changed by a factor of about 20\nwithout changing the amount of information transmitted more\nthan a small percentage. Different groupings of the pitches de-\ncreased the transmission, but the loss was small. For example, if\nyou can discriminate five high-pitched tones in one series and\nfive low-pitched tones in another series, it is reasonable to expect\nthat you could combine all ten into a single series and still tell\nthem all apart without error. When you try it, however, it does\nnot work. The channel capacity for pitch seems to be about six\nand that is the best you can do.\nWhile we are on tones, let us look next at Garner's (7) work\non loudness. Garner's data for loudness are summarized in Fig.\n2. Garner went to some trouble to get the best possible spacing\nof his tones over the intensity range from 15 to 110 db. He used\n4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 20 different stimulus intensities. The results\nshown in Fig. 2 take into account the differences among subjects\nand the sequential influence of the immediately preceding judg-\nment. Again we find that there seems to be a limit. The channel\ncapacity for absolute judgments of loudness is 2.3 bits, or about\nfive perfectly discriminable alternatives.\nSince these two studies were done in different laboratories\nwith slightly different techniques and methods of analysis, we\nare not in a good position to argue whether five loudnesses is\nsignificantly different from six pitches. Probably the difference\nis in the right direction, and absolute judgments of pitch are\nslightly more accurate than absolute judgments of loudness.\nThe important point, however, is that the two answers are of the\nsame order of magnitude.\nThe experiment has also been done for taste intensities. In\nFig. 3 are the results obtained by Beebe-Center, Rogers, and\nO'Connell (1) for absolute judgments of the concentration of\nsalt solutions. The concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 34.7 gm.\nNaCl per 100 cc. tap water in equal subjective steps. They used\n3,5,9, and 17 different concentrations.

Hake and Garner\n(8) asked observers to interpolate visually between two scale\nmarkers. Their results are shown in Fig. 4. They did the experi-\nment in two ways. In one version they let the observer use any\nnumber between zero and 100 to describe the position, although\nthey presented stimuli at only 5, 10, 20, or 50 different posi-\ntions. The results with this unlimited response technique are\nshown by the filled circles on the graph. In the other version the\nobservers were limited in their responses to reporting just those\nstimulus values that were possible. That is to say, in the second\nversion the number of different responses that the observer\ncould make was exactly the same as the number of different\nstimuli that the experimenter might present. The results with\nthis limited response technique are shown by the open circles\non the graph. The two functions are so similar that it seems\nfair to conclude that the number of responses available to the\nobserver had nothing to do with the channel capacity of 3.25\nbits.\nThe Hake-Gamer experiment has been repeated by Coonan\n12345", metadata={'page': 2.0, 'source': 'knowledge_base\\the-magical-number-7-plus-or-minus-2-some-limits-on-our-capacity-for-processing-information.pdf'}), 0.158457756), (Document(page_content="racy for any particular variable. In other words, we can make\nrelatively crude judgments of several things simultaneously.\nWe might argue that in the course of evolution those organ-\nisms were most successful that were responsive to the widest\nrange of stimulus energies in their environment. In order to sur-\nvive in a constantly fluctuating world, it was better to have a\nlittle information about a lot of things than to have a lot of in-\nformation about a small segment of the environment. If a com-\npromise was necessary, the one we seem to have made is clearly\nthe more adaptive.\nPollack and Ficks's results are very strongly suggestive of an\nargument that linguists and phoneticians have been making for\nsome time (11). According to the linguistic analysis of the\nsounds of human speech, there are about eight or ten dimen-\nsionsthe linguists call them distinctive featuresthat distin-\nguish one phoneme from another. These distinctive features are\nusually binary, or at most ternary, in nature. For example, a\nbinary distinction is made between vowels and consonants, a\nbinary decision is made between oral and nasal consonants, a\nternary decision is made among front, middle, and back pho-\nnemes, etc. This approach gives us quite a different picture of\nspeech perception than we might otherwise obtain from our\nstudies of the speech spectrum and of the ear's ability to dis-\ncriminate relative differences among pure tones. I am person-\nally much interested in this new approach (15), and I regret that\nthere is not time to discuss it here.\nIt was probably with this linguistic theory in mind that Pol-\nlack and Picks conducted a test on a set of tonal stimuli that\nvaried in eight dimensions, but required only a binary decision\non each dimension. With these tones they measured the\ntransmitted information at 6.9 bits, or about 120 recognizable\nkinds of sounds. It is an intriguing question, as yet unexplored,\nwhether one can go on adding dimensions indefinitely in this\nway.\nIn human speech there is clearly a limit to the number of\ndimensions that we use.
